# Floods in São Paulo

In this github we store our data to analyze the floods of São Paulo city from the year 2019. It contais four main files, three of data set and one of code. The data set consists of

## floods.csv

A CSV containing the longitude and latitude, the name of the street, a reference, the date of flood, the month of flood, the hour it began, the hour it finished, the duration and the duration in hours. So, each line of this CSV is an occurrance of flood in the year of 2019, inside São Paulo. This data set was heavily worked on by one of our colleagues (thanks Livia!) to ensure a precise crossing.
